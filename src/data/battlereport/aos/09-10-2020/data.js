Winner is the player controlling the objective at the end of 5th battleround. Ralf : Sylvaneth Gijs : Chaos Everchosen Jim : Kharadron Overlords Pictures are at end of phase Set Up:The Sylvaneth deployed their melee Kurnoth hunters with Durthu aimed at the objective, whilst the forest worth of dryads were set up to shield the bow wielding Hunters at the rear. Archeon was set up in the zone furthest from the objective, eager to swoop forward with varenguard, slaughterbeast and warriors flanking him close-by. The Kharadrons's loaded everyone on foot in the Ironclad, with the balloon dwarfs deployed in tight formation around it.",

Only a single group of warriors advanced menacingly towards the dwarf forces. The Kharadron endrinriggers positioned themselves to get a bead on the Sylvaneth with their heavy weapons, causing only minor damage to durthu. Whilst the Ironclad slowly scraped it's overloaded hull into a firing position and subsequently blasting (together with it's garrison) the approaching group of chaos warriors to meet their gods.",

Meanwhile Durthu and his accompanying Kurnoth hunters continued their slow jog around the blocking tower, closing in on the Kharadrons and coming close to controlling the objective. The Kharadron, seeing the looming shadow of Archeon in the distance, decide on carefully advancing toward the objective as far away from the forces of Chaos as they can. Though in their caution they fail to cause any damage with their ranged fire this turn. The Everchosen surged forward towards the Sylvaneth lines, slamming into the dryads with Archeon, the slaughterbeast and the Varanguard, butchering all but a single one.",

Archeon and the slaughterbeast crashed into and subsequently squashed the Kurnoth archers in the sylvaneth rearguard, clearing the way for a dash towards the objective next turn. With the Sylvaneth swarming over the objective, the Kharadron decided to loose some weight by deploying a squad of arkhanouts and use the Ironclads Fly-High to reposition everyone except the unfortunate arkhanouts at the other side of the board. After touching down they let loose with every available weapon and managed to take down two varanguard and dealing severe damage to Archeon.",

The remnants of the chaos army completely ignored the Sylvaneth as they to ran at full pace towards the objective. Managing to claim the objective by weight of numbers, for now. Confident in their positioning, the Kharadrons deployed their thunderers from the Ironclad to regain control of the objective. The subsequent fire was supremely underwhelming, with the Silvaneth losing a single Kurnoth hunter and no casualties on the chaos side. MVP of this rounds shooting goes to the Kharadron general, who managed to fumble with his Phosphorite Bomblets and drop them fizzling in the mud. (rolling 2+ is difficult okay!)",
